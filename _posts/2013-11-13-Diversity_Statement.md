#Diversity Statement#

We are working on this project in a class, and we welcome anyone who wants to learn in a classroom environment. Therefore we
encourage programmers of all levels to participate. We ask that anyone who wants to join and contribute be respectful of others
working on this project as well. Constructive criticism is welcome as it encourages learning and growth, as long as you're nice about it.

For more information, please go to [UNC Chapel Hill's School of Library and Information Science student diversity statement](https://sils.unc.edu/about/diversity)

*P.S. We don't feed trolls.*
