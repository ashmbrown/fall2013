title: "New py-game, Pepper Pusher!"
___


Playing with Gimp was really fun. It's a very user friendly photoshop alternative. I like that it has the layer capabilities photoshop/illustrator has, and some features like transparent backgrounds are way easier to use. 

For some reason, one of the gimp "paint brushes" was a picture of a pepper, which I thought was great! I used this to create a "new" game: Pepper Pusher. 

See some screenshots below!
