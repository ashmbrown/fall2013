I made changes to Starpusher's appearance by locating the files that were called on and either creating a new file and giving it the name that is called on, or by adding a new file and changing the call. Mario became the first character, a pepper replaced the star (though the game still calls on star to call the pepper image) and our former vice president set the boundaries for the game. Fun!

I also located the background and text colors in the starpusher.py file and replaced them with better colors. Check it out.
