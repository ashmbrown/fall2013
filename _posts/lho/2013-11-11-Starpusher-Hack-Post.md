title: Ron Burgundy Starpusher
---

This was actually pretty fun!  I was playing around with this game, especially with what image size would be best not only for the game, but also for the picture. This resulted in me trying out alot of different image sizes.  So in the spirit of movies that are hilarious and goofy, I decided to honor the recent trailer of Anchorman 2 and do a Ron Burgundy themed Starpusher!  So I actually have Ron Burgundy pushed scotch glasses around. Here's a screenshot: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GwrhLnA.png">

Here's another screenshot of me coding: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/cL4zTAO.png">

So the things I changed in the Pygame were the color, the text color, the changing of the princess character, the changing of the star component, and the height and width of the window.
