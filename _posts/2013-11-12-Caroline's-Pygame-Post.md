So, when I first started playing around with Starpusher, I learned something:
I am terrible at Starpusher.

Thankfully, now that I knew how to work with pygame, I could cheat without cheating! 
So, I opened the file to edit the levels with `nano starPusherLevels.txt`. The directions in the file were incredibly easy to follow. So first, I edited a level to make it easier:

Then, I made a whole new level from scratch:

I also edited the background color to a nicer blue by going into `starpusher.py` and changing the RGB values so it read `BRIGHTBLUE = (132, 227, 225)`.
Overall, I thought it was really easy working with PyGame and had a lot of fun with it!
