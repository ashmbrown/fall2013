I had fun with this assignment. It seems like there's a lot you can do, but the building blocks are fairly straightforward. The first thing I did was to edit some colors, like the background, which should be evident in the images in this post (I opted for a darker blue as opposed to sky blue in the original). Next, I wanted to do some rule-breaking:

Notice anything strange here? Our princess has jumped the wall! Or rather, walked through it. I made a quick modification to the `def is Wall()` function by commenting out the code block beneath the function header like so:

This way, we keep our function should we want it for future when our guilty conscience catches up with us after proceeding to level 10 after 20 minutes.

Next, I felt good when I got through a level, but I wanted something a little more enthusiastic. So, I changed what the value that the `"solved"` key referred to like so:

This just changes the value in the `dict` to an image called `thumbsup.png` that I'd found in Google images. So, having made that little change, here's what it looks like when I finish levels now:

Probably not as informative, but much more enthusiastic I think.
