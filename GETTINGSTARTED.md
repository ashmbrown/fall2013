SILSHack Getting Started {#welcome}
=====================


What is SILSHack and Why should you care?
---------
SILSHack is a collaborativeley authored blog for INLS560 (Programming for Information Professionals) at [The School of Information and Library Science](http://sils.unc.edu) at [UNC Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu).

This site is built off of [Professor Jekyll](http://github.com/silshack/professorjekyll), a collaborative course blog with support for multiple authors based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  The site is hosted by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

It's crucial to teach modern programming tools alongside basic coding skills.  Git and Github are valuable and pervasive tools, but they're seldom integrated into programming classes. 

Our goal is to make it easy to set up a collaborative companion blog for their courses.  Students can get comfortable with using [Github Flow in the Browser](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser) (or even a simple push-to-master flow in the very beginning), _in parallel to_ learning their for loops, if statements, and flow of control.  As the course progresses, add in issues, pull requests, and even milestones.

## Setting up SILSHack
If you want to set up your own Courseblog like this, go fork [Professor Jekyll](http://github.com/silshack/professorjekyll). You don't want all the cruft and posts we've made in your new project.
For everyone else there are a couple of files to pay attention to  

Notably:  

* `_config.yml` - this is where you'll define your course and author information. 
* `_layouts/default.html` - the pages are hard-coded into the header.  You'll also likely want to change the footer a little.
* `css/main.css` - I haven't touched the base CSS beyond some minor tweaks. 

See tutorials [like this one](http://silshack.github.io/fall2013/2013/10/14/another-post.html) to get the blog running locally.
